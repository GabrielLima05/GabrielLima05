My passion for technology and the desire to create innovative solutions guide my daily work.

My main focus is on the development and implementation of computerized systems, actively collaborating in process optimization and technical support. I always seek excellence and customer satisfaction, and I consider the ability to work in a team and adaptability as essential differentiators in my role.
